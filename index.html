        At the end of 2017 I started studying machine learning and doing 
        related projects full time. I completed Andrew Ng's 
        <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">Machine 
        Learning Coursera course</a>, and his 
        <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning">Deep 
        Learning specialization</a> series of five 
        smaller courses. I also attended the <a href="http://course.fast.ai/">
        Fast.ai Deep Learning course</a> in person in December.
    </p>
    <p>
        Previously I was a lead software engineer at 
        <a href="https://fetchrobotics.com/">Fetch Robotics</a> where I did
        front and backend web development as well as some product management.
        Before that I was briefly CEO of my own consumer robotics 
        company where we made furry robot pets. I've also written code for 
        <a href="https://numenta.com/">Numenta</a> (machine intelligence 
        research), <a href="http://www.anybots.com/">AnyBots</a> (telepresence 
        robotics), and <a href="http://www.pbworks.com/">PBWorks</a> (hosted 
        wikis).
    </p>
    <p>
        Before my technical career I earned a B.A. in Psychology from Whitman
        College and did graduate neuroscience course work with Kenneth Campbell 
        of the <a href="https://www.uottawa.ca/brain/">Brain and Mind Research 
        Institute</a> at the University of Ottawa.
    </p>
    <h2>Research Interests</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Motor Unit Control</strong> - Inspired by Daniel Wolpert's 
        movement chauvinism I want to build systems that learn to control 
        muscles. I work with simulated agents rigged with muscles at various 
        levels of fidelity.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Learned Reward Signals</strong> - How do we augment 
        reinforcement learning to overcome the reward shaping problem? What are 
        the mechanisms by which an agent can learn what should constitute a 
        reward and what should not. I approach this problem from the perspective
        of operant conditioning and ask what systems must be implemented in an 
        agent to produce behavior similar to that in biological systems under 
        the control of various schedules of reinforcement.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Curriculum Learning</strong>  - How do we progressively modify 
        an agent's environment such that tasks with otherwise sparse reward 
        signals can be learned efficiently? 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Lifelong Learning</strong> - How do we accomplish all of the 
        above without suffering from catastrophic forgetting? 
    </p>
    <h2>Publications</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Thesis - <a href='https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=Distinguishing+addiction+and+high+engagement+in+the+context+of+online+game+playing&btnG='>Distinguishing addiction and high engagement in the context of online game playing</a> (700+ citations)
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Connect</h2>
    <p>
        I am open to hearing about opportunities in machine learning (research 
        and applied) and web development supporting the same. While I appreciate
        the interest, I will politely decline work focused on self-driving 
        cars or military applications of ML/AI.
