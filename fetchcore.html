    <h2>Design</h2>
    <img src="images/fetchcore-v1-design.png"/>
    <p>
        The very first incarnation of Fetchcore circa 2015.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Fetchcore</strong> was designed to make directing a fleet of
        robots easy. Where other systems were slow to set up and required
        significant training or programming to use, Fetchcore was intended for
        busy warehouse managers. It was also designed to be a near real-time
        system such that you could watch and direct robots live in your 
        warehouses. In addition it was designed with an eye to providing
        significant functionality even on mobile devices. 
    </p>
    <p>
        From the beginning Fetchcore was seen as an important differentiator 
        between Fetch and its competitors. After we successfully secured a $20M 
        funding round led by <a href="https://www.softbank.jp/en/">Softbank</a>
        we started a major revision to the UI.
    </p>
    <img src="images/fetchcore-wireframes-02.png"/>
    <p>
        I made initial wireframes using <a href="https://balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a> 
        which layed out page structure, expected workflows, error conditions, 
        and details of user interaction. In conjunction with our talented 
        designer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ddymesich/">David Dymesich</a>
        these were then converted into mockups and tested internally with
        select users, refined and then implemented.
    </p>
    <h2>Implementation</h2>
    <p>
        Fetchcore was designed as a mobile friendly React application built
        around a core real-time map component. In addition to visualizing the
        current location of robots in a given warehouse a crucial workflow for
        Fetchcore users was annotating the map such that robots would avoid
        certain locations, be aware of the names of specific points, and be
        guided along preferred paths. Redux was used initially to provide
        easy undo-redo functionality during annotation but quickly became an
        indispensable tool for state management and decoupling components.

    <p>
        A later incarnation of the map annotation interface.
    </p>
    <p>
        The most challenging aspect of developing this UI was the interface
        between React and the mapping component. Initially it was developed
        using <a href="https://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a> which did not have
        React integration at the time. Leaflet provided a scalable tiled map
        paradigm, mobile support out of the box, and numerous plugins. Drawing
        plugins were initially used to provide users a way to mark out no-go
        areas on the map for the robots, lanes they should use for travel,
        and destinations. Eventually our needs diverged from the functionality
        Leaflet provided and we rebuilt the mapping component from scratch
        on top of <a href="http://paperjs.org/">Paper.js</a>. This did not
        relieve the core tension between the declarative paradigm of React and
        the imperative structure of our mapping component, but allowed us a 
        great deal of flexibility in design.
    </p>
    <h2>Growth</h2>
    <p>
        While I was the sole frontend developer for the very first generation
        of Fetchcore, subsequent revisions would not have been possible without
        a growing team of talented developers we recruited as well as the
        services of <a href="https://cogniance.com/">Cogniance</a>. Managing a 
        globally distributed team on a project with continually expanding 
        ambitions was one of the more challenging things I've ever done. I am 
        proud of what that team was able to accomplish. Subsequent to the 
        release of several major revisions to Fetchcore, Fetch secured an 
        additional $25M led by <a href="https://swayvc.com/">Sway Ventures</a>. 
        In no little part, I'm sure, due to Fetchcore. [end sarcasm]
